# Machine Learning Practice Projects (Python)

This repository contains my personal machine learning and computer vision practice projects in Python.  
The goal is to build a solid **basic–intermediate** understanding of ML by implementing algorithms from scratch or with popular libraries, experimenting on real datasets, and keeping everything in clean, reproducible `.py` scripts (instead of only Jupyter notebooks).

## 🔍 What’s inside

- **Self-contained ML projects**  
  Each project lives in its own folder with:
  - A main Python script (converted from Jupyter notebooks)
  - A small dataset (CSV or similar) if needed
  - Optional notes or results

- **Topics covered (so far / planned)**  
  This will grow over time, but includes things like:
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification
  - Data preprocessing & feature scaling
  - Basic data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Train/test splits & model evaluation
  - Linear & logistic regression  
  - Decision trees & ensembles  
  - Unsupervised learning (k-Means, clustering, PCA)  
  - Intro computer vision / image-based models
